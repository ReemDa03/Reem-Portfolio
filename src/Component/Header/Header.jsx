          I focused on building fast, responsive, and scalable applications
          using React.js, React Native, and Firebase as a full back-end solution
          (BaaS). Passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and creating
          intuitive UI/UX experiences. Currently converting my projects into a
          mobile app using React Native. Open to remote opportunities where I
          can contribute to meaningful, user-focused projects.
